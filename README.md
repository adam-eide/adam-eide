Hi! I love working on new projects. Lately I have been focusing on react native and my goals are creating a great recipe app in React Native and creating a clicker/idle game with MonoGame. 
I cook a lot and I want to make a recipe app that lets people find what they are looking for without plaguing them with a 10,000 word blog post or full screen ads. 
I am also fascinated by fun exponential growth algorithms so I want to make a fun idle/clicker game with no micro transaction.
